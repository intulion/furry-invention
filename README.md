## [Project: Smart Calculator](https://hyperskill.org/projects/88)

Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), you will learn a lot about arrays, stacks, strings, and queues. You will also get closer experience with 2 important data structures: the stack and the queue. You will also gain firsthand experience with the BigInteger class.
